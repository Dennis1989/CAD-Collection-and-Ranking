          For the purpose of scientific research, needs-based design, and continuous optimization in connection with various value-added services (e.g., search term recommenders, various ranking procedures) provided on our webpages, we use an analysis service for the search function on the GESIS website, which is installed on our own Web server. We record actions, for example searches conducted with search terms, document views, and clicking on links. In this connection, pseudonymized usage profiles are created, and cookies (see above) are used.

        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          GESIS integrates deactivated social media buttons that do not establish contact with the servers of Facebook & Co. Only when the user activates these and thus declares their consent to communication with Facebook or Twitter do the buttons become active and establish the connection. The user can then submit their recommendation with a second click. If the user is already logged into the social network of their choice, Facebook will do so without another window. On Twitter, a pop-up window appears in which the text of the tweet can still be edited.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          Clicking on one of these buttons thus means that the user gives their consent to transmit data to the respective operator of the social network but only for this one page and for the selected service. When calling up further GESIS pages, the deactivated button appears again. In this way, you can use the social networks without them being able to create complete surfing profiles right away.

          Our website uses social plugins (“plugins”) provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins are identifiable by a Facebook logo (white letter f on a blue background or a thumb-up icon) or the notice “Facebook Social Plugin.” For a full list of all social Plugins, please see <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/plugins" className="text-blue-500 underline" target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com/plugins.</a>
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          When you visit a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser, which embeds the latter into the website, enabling Facebook to receive information about your having accessed the respective page of our website. Thus, we have no influence on the data gathered by the plugin and inform you according to our state of knowledge: The embedded plugins provide Facebook with the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like” or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. Even if you are not logged into Facebook, there is the possibility that the plugins transmit your IP address to Facebook.
